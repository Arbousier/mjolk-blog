    <description>&lt;h2&gt;Mjölk goes beta and live&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hello everyone, this is first post of the Mjölk blog. Mjölk is a bookmarking engine licensed under &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MIT&lt;/span&gt; to bring a simple alternative to some big names.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mjölk is swedish for milk.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was mainly started to provide a safe harbor after the Delicious rumors. The goal was to create something that will be easily managed and perpetuated in all situations. But now it&#8217;s somehow different with a code base growing quickly and some ideas running.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are working a lot to finish the first set of functionnalities but already there the really basic ones : bookmark with tags, tag clouds, private bookmarks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The registration is open, with a 42 beta testers quota. After that (about 30 seats left right now) we will lock any new accounts until we finish some stages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until then some news will come here.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
