h2. Mjölk goes beta and live

Hello everyone, this is first post of the Mjölk blog. Mjölk is a bookmarking engine licensed under MIT to bring a simple alternative to some big names.

_Mjölk is swedish for milk._

It was mainly started to provide a safe harbor after the Delicious rumors. The goal was to create something that will be easily managed and perpetuated in all situations. But now it's somehow different with a code base growing quickly and some ideas running.

We are working a lot to finish the first set of functionnalities but already there the really basic ones : bookmark with tags, tag clouds, private bookmarks.

The registration is open, with a 42 beta testers quota. After that (about 30 seats left right now) we will lock any new accounts until we finish some stages.

Until then some news will come here.
