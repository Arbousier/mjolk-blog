h2. One up : 0.4

Some days have passed, some code has been written, removed, rewritten, removed and rewritten. And we (yes, I had some help this time) are quite happy to release Mj√∂lk 0.4. Still a beta, with probably some bugs here and there but it's a big leap forward as two big features have been added :

- followers and followed users
- users groups

This is definetly not finished since the interface needs improvements, interconnections with some other services etc ... We also have the api is usable since 0.3.1 to post new bookmarks.

So now we need some feedback, some bug reports : fiddle around and send us some feedback (on anything : design, features, bugs, ...) then pass the link to someone you know and who might be interested. There is still room for beta testers.

Thanks to madprog and neuro` for handy feedback and advices on code and design.
